NEWS for rsync 3.0.6 (8 May 2009)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.5:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a --read-batch hang when rsync is reading a batch file that was
      created from an incremental-recursion transfer.

    - Fixed the daemon's socket code to handle the simultaneous arrival of
      multiple connections.

    - Fix --safe-links/--copy-unsafe-links to properly handle symlinks that
      have consecutive slashes in the value.

    - Fixed the parsing of an [IPv6_LITERAL_ADDR] when a USER@ is prefixed.

    - The sender now skips a (bogus) symlink that has a 0-length value, which
      avoids a transfer error in the receiver.

    - Fixed a case where the sender could die with a tag-0 error if there was
      an I/O during the sending of the file list.

    - Fixed the rrsync script to avoid a server-side problem when -e is at the
      start of the short options.

    - Fixed a problem where a vanished directory could turn into an exit code
      23 instead of the proper exit code 24.

    - Fixed the --iconv conversion of symlinks when doing a local copy.

    - Fixed a problem where --one-file-system was not stopping deletions on the
      receiving side when a mount-point directory did not match a directory in
      the transfer.

    - Fixed the dropping of an ACL mask when no named ACL values were present.

    - Fixed an ACL/xattr corruption issue where the --backup option could cause
      rsync to associate the wrong ACL/xattr information with received files.

    - Fixed the use of --xattrs with --only-write-batch.

    - Fixed the use of --dry-run with --read-batch.

    - Fixed configure's erroneous use of target.

    - Fixed configure's --disable-debug option.

    - Fixed a run-time issue for systems that can't find iconv_open() by adding
      the --disable-iconv-open configure option.

    - Complain and die if the user tries to combine --remove-source-files (or
      the deprecated --remove-sent-files) with --read-batch.

    - Fixed an failure transferring special files from Solaris to Linux.
