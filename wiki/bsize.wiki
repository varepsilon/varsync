= Mathematical models =

Mathematical model was exhaustively studied in [http://samba.org/~tridge/phd_thesis.pdf Andrew Tridgell's PhD thesis] in chapter 3.3, page 58 (_page 67_ in pdf file). He shows that the best choice for block size is the *square root of file size*.

= Experimental results =

Most experimental results shows that computational complexity of algorithm depends on block size very little. But communicational complexity does depend on it.
