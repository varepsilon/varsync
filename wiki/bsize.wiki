= Mathematical models =

Coming soon.

= Experimental results =

Most experimental results shows that computational complexity of algorithm depends on block size very little. But communicational complexity does depend on it.

== Results for opera test pair ==
Here you can see graph for opera test pair. More information can be found in benchmark/bsize directory.
