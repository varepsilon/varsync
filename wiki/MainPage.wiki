Work is in progress now.
== Statistics ==
Stats can be viewed [http://code.google.com/p/varsync/wiki/stats here].
== Profiling ==
Profiling results can be viewed [http://code.google.com/p/varsync/wiki/profiling here].
== Different implementations: ==
=== Random implementation ===
Random implementation comprise two ideas:
  # Random-based weak checksum (--random option)
  # Random-based strong checksum (--random2 option)
First idea aims to give easy-to-calculate *weak checksum* with the same rolling property (see [http://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/node3.html original implementation]) based on random-generated numbers. More information about the idea can be found [http://code.google.com/p/varsync/wiki/idea here].

Second idea is about security despite it's being easy-to-calculate also. It uses the same technique as first idea but is more stronger. Opposite to the original md4-based technique it doesn't rely on the strength of any sum: it is random =)
